## About Me
I'm 22 years old. I have no experience in the field of programming, so I chose a preparatory course for myself, and in the future the main course in Front-End. After graduating from university, I did not continue in the direction that I liked (Front-End) and worked in another area. Within 6 months of work, I understood that I needed to continue doing what I liked. Therefore, I am now striving to catch up with everything that was lost and learn more new things in order to work in this area.

## Code Example
Codewars:
```
function solution(number){
  let a=0;
  for(let i=3;i<number;i++){
    if(i%3===0 || i%5===0) {
      a +=i;
    }
  }
    return a;
}

solution(10);
```
